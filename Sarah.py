# Description: This program is an interactive data-driven, web-based Python application that uses
# real-world data to display various outputs for users. This program will use Boston Trash Data, obtained
# from (http://data.boston.gov), the city of Bostonâ€™s open data hub. The data in this program specifically
# was narrowed down to 7000 random lines of that data set, due to its large size.
# I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
# Any external resources used are detailed in the code.
# I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
# I have not given my code to any student.
# Starting the functions
